## Licensing

Gridfinity is Â©2022-2023 Zach Freedman.

Zach [actually decided to relicense](https://youtu.be/ofI2OCq_QqA?t=343), so
this project and the example models are now available under the
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

For models released before April 2nd of 2023, you may continue using the silly
[CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)
license terms, because they are irrevocable. But *why would you*!?
